# Periodic Table

The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements, ordered by their atomic number, electron configuration, and recurring chemical properties.

## History

The modern periodic table was developed by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869. He arranged the elements in order of increasing atomic weight and noticed that elements with similar properties occurred at regular intervals.

## Structure

- **Periods**: Horizontal rows in the periodic table
- **Groups**: Vertical columns in the periodic table
- **Atomic Number**: Number of protons in an atom's nucleus

## Element Classification

### Metals

- Good conductors of heat and electricity
- Malleable and ductile
- Usually solid at room temperature (except mercury)

### Non-metals

- Poor conductors of heat and electricity
- Brittle in solid state
- Can be solid, liquid, or gas at room temperature

### Metalloids

- Properties intermediate between metals and non-metals
- Examples: Silicon (Si), Germanium (Ge), Arsenic (As)

## Periodic Trends

1. **Atomic Radius**: Generally decreases across a period, increases down a group
2. **Ionization Energy**: Generally increases across a period, decreases down a group
3. **Electronegativity**: Generally increases across a period, decreases down a group

## Notable Elements

- **Hydrogen (H)**: Atomic number 1, simplest element
- **Carbon (C)**: Atomic number 6, basis of organic chemistry
- **Silicon (Si)**: Atomic number 14, important in semiconductors
- **Iron (Fe)**: Atomic number 26, essential for life and industry
- **Gold (Au)**: Atomic number 79, precious metal

## Modern Periodic Table

The current periodic table contains 118 confirmed elements, with the most recent additions being:

- Nihonium (Nh, 113)
- Moscovium (Mc, 115)
- Tennessine (Ts, 117)
- Oganesson (Og, 118)

These super-heavy elements are highly unstable and have very short half-lives.
